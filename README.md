# My-portfolio
link : https://pmaheshrao.github.io/My-portfolio/ 

I created a Portfolio site using HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript to show my personal details like About Me, My Skills, My resume and My Social media links  . Used JavaScript to create responsive navigation bar and used CSS to add designs and style to the website.
