# My Portfolio

I created a Portfolio site using HTML, 
CSS and a small amount of JavaScript to 
show my personal details like About Me, 
My Skills, My resume and My social media handles .

Used JavaScript to create responsive navigation 
bar and used CSS to add designs and make the website responsive .
